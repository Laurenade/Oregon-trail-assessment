// The Traveler class (blueprint) should set the following 
// properties for each instance:
//  -- a name, which must be provided as a parameter to the constructor.
//  -- an amount of food, with an initial value of 1.
//  -- an isHealthy property, with an initial value of true, which 
//      indicates whether a traveler is sick.
// The Traveler class should also have the following methods:
//      -- hunt() - Increases the traveler's food by 2.
//      -- eat() - Consumes 1 unit of the traveler's food. If the 
//          traveler doesn't have any food left to eat, the traveler 
//          is no longer healthy (set isHealthy to false).
